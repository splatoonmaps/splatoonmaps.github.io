# Splatoon â€“ Map Statistics

Displays statistics of Splatoon's Map/Game Mode frequency.

### To Do
- [ ] add a favicon
- [x] display total number of rotations on :hover
- [ ] make maps sortable (by Game mode)
  - [ ] think about ui/design in general
  - [ ] let user choose between view by month/view by map
- [ ] display combined number of map rotations per month
- [x] add additional data (might have to add Splatfest by hand)
